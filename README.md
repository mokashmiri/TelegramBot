# Telegram Bot
Welcome to the Bot-Telegram repository!


GenreBot is an interactive Telegram bot crafted to streamline the music categorization process. Designed with a user-friendly interface, it allows users to upload music files and classify them by genre with a simple button click. Developed in Python, the bot features a robust validation system to ensure only authorized users can interact with it. Each music file is tagged with the user's name and the chosen genre before being forwarded to a predefined group, creating an organized and engaging music sharing experience.
